# CS-141
A project predicting housing price distributions.

## Running the website
Download the repo, and navigate to `CS-141/Frontend/hacksociety` in a terminal window. Make sure you have Python 3 and Django, installed (you can find documentation for this online), and run the command `python manage.py runserver`. This will run the server, and say something like `Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Open a browser window, and navigate to the given url `/home`. For example, we would navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/home` in this case. Congrats! You should be at the website, and be able to switch tabs to the maps page.
